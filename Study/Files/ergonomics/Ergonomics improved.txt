Ergonomic Stressor 

Conditions that puts the human body under biomechanical stress and raise the possibility of developing musculoskeletal illnesses. Some examples of these stressors are motions, contact pressure, vibration, and cold temperatures. (Ergonomics: The Study of Work, OSHA) There are three primary ergonomic risk factors which tends to transform itself as an ergonomic stressor:

· Awkward Posture

· High Force Requirements

· Repetitive Motions 

These ergonomic risk factors and ergonomic stressors, if exposed over long durations could increase fatigue and uneasiness in your soft tissues and body which leads to many short-term and long-term symptoms.

Why Ergonomics? 

Ergonomics aims to create safe, comfortable, and productive workspaces by bringing human abilities and limitations into the design of a workspace, including the individual’s body size, strength, skill, speed, sensory abilities. When evaluating a job, one should look for three main characteristics known as ergonomic stressors:

· Force required to complete a task,

· Awkward/static work posture

· Repetitiveness of a task. 

Why does it matter? 
The entire economic cost of work-related diseases and injuries is estimated by Safe Work Australia to be $60 billion. Based on recent studies, lower back pain is the most prevalent work-related ailment worldwide, impacting workers in offices, construction sites, and agriculture—the industry with the highest risk.

Ergonomics Topics

In understanding Ergonomics, it is often time helpful to understand the various topics of importance:

1. Lifting and Material Handling

One of the main causes of job injuries is lifting large objects. Shoulder and back injuries accounted for more than 36% of injuries resulting in missed workdays, according to a 2001 Bureau of Labor Statistics analysis. Combined trauma and overexertion were the main causes of these injuries. Bending was the movement most frequently mentioned as the cause of back pain, followed by twisting and turning. Manually moving things can sometimes result in strains and sprains from inappropriate lifting techniques or from carrying loads that are too heavy or bulky.

 

2. Musculoskeletal Disorders

Cumulative trauma disorders, another name for musculoskeletal diseases (MSDs), are gradual-onset injuries that typically follow repeated micro-traumas to a particular body component. Due to the gradual emergence of symptoms, they can take weeks, months, or even years to manifest, and at first they are frequently disregarded. MSDs most frequently impact the back, shoulders, wrists, neck, and eyes. They specifically impact the muscles, tendons, and nerves in certain regions. Though they are less prevalent, MSDs can also affect particular fingers, elbows, and the knees. Muscle, nerve, tendon, ligament, joint, cartilage, and spinal disc problems are collectively referred to as MSDs. Rotator cuff syndrome, DeQuervain's disease, trigger finger, Tarsal tunnel syndrome, sciatica, epicondylitis, and tendinitis are a few instances of MSDs.

3. Office Ergonomics

Many people are unaware that poor workstation design and/or unhealthful work habits can lead to major health issues. In addition to headaches and eyestrain, common symptoms of bad design or habits include discomfort in the hands, wrists, neck, and back. An ergonomic workplace and good work habits can reduce discomfort and perhaps stop it from starting in the first place! Office equipment can be easily adjusted to greatly improve both the comfort and productivity of work.

 

4. Laboratory Ergonomics

Ergonomic stressors have numerous potential in laboratories to materialize as injuries or repetitive stress diseases. In a laboratory context, the most common ergonomic problems are awkward or static postures and repetitive activities. To find out more about reducing these stressors, use this link.

 

5. Hospital Ergonomics

Ergonomic stressors have numerous possibilities in hospitals to lead to injuries or repetitive stress disorders. In hospitals, uncomfortable postures and patient handling are major ergonomic problems. To find out more about reducing these stressors, use this link.

6. Ergonomics for the Home and Hobby

When thinking about ergonomics, one should not limit their considerations to the workplace. Numerous pastimes and routine activities carried out outside of the job may give rise to ergonomic pressures. To find out more about reducing these pressures in your daily life, use the links below.

 

Interesting Snippet: 

Soldiers who spent more time in cramped quarters, tanks, and boats during World War II—where they were submerged for extended periods of time—began to have back and blood circulation problems. It affected their productivity as well as their morale. In order to help people create more while avoiding health problems, the engineers set to work reimagining such sectors. And from there ergonomics originated.
